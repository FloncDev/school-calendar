# School Calendar
A web server that takes in my schedule as a json file and returns it in .ical format. Used to show my class schedule on my calendar.

### Todo
- [ ] Add term dates
    - This also means not generating calendar events during the holidays
- [ ] Add homework due
- [ ] Add integration with Edulink ical export
    - Edulink is the software my school uses, it supports export to ICAL but only for the next week.
- [ ] Add school events
- [ ] Add period 7 and 8 + clubs
    - After school extra lessons / clubs. Could change on a weekly basis
    - Could also mean adding a scheduler to make sure I go to everything I want to equally
- [x] Dockerize
